keyring : Keyring 'keyring' @root
"Your keyring is kindof barren. It\'s old enough that it\'s not as hard to separate it to put keys on, though. So, you\'ve got that going for you, which is nice." { }

flashlight : Flashlight 'flashlight' @root

leaflet : Thing '(small) leaflet' 'leaflet' @the_cut

Note that, as opposed to other courses, you can think about most of these problems while waking around and doing mechanical errands. Cheers, Irina\"\b You think you can see tears on the bottom, but those could just as easily be from the rain. " {

        The story goes on to describe the graduation ceremonies, which went off without a hitch.\n Suddenly, a horrible realization dawns on you.  That was YOUR graduation.  And you don't remember any of it!  Dazedly you check the date on the paper -- sure enough, two days after graduation. You must have slept completely through it!  You didn't graduate, and you didn't get your diploma, and now you're not going to get that new Porsche from MegaMissles, Inc., either.  Without a diploma, they'll never hire you, no matter what that recruiter said. \n<b>You're dead meat.</b>\n";
